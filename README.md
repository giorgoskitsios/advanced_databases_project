We used resources from AWS in order to run the queries efficiently. In this project we analysed Crime Data from the LA area. We used many datasets like "Los Angeles Crime Data", "LA Police Stations", "Median Household Income by Zip Code", "2010 Census Blocks", "Race and Ethnicity Codes", where we merged csv and geoJSON data to achieve the necessary results.
